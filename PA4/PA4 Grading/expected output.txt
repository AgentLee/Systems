3 points per test case



--------



1. too many arguments

2. too few arguments

3. index file doesn’t exist

4. index file is empty (graceful non-segfault upon execution)

5. q

6. sa, 1 term, not found

7. sa, 1 term, found

8. sa, 2 terms, both found, no overlap

9. sa, 2 terms, both found, some overlap

10. sa, 2 terms, both found, some overlap, case insensitivity

11. sa, 3 terms, one missing, some overlap

12. sa, 4 terms, all found, some overlap

13. so, 1 term, not found

14. so, 1 term, found

15. so, 2 terms, both found, no overlap

16. so, 2 terms, both found, some overlap

17. so, 2 terms, both found, some overlap, case insensitivity

18. so, 3 terms, one missing, some overlap

19. so, 4 terms, all found, some overlap

20. single term, appears in 1 file

Here are some examples showing how we actually tested 6-20:

First, run ./index output.txt testdir/
Second, run ./search output.txt
Then input command (-> indicates the expected output)
 


6: sa goat -> Empty

7: sa mary -> 1.txt 2.txt 3.txt

8: sa little lamb -> Empty

9: sa mary lamb -> 3.txt

10: sa MARy LamB -> 3.txt

11: sa mary lamb emu -> Empty

12: sa mary had a little -> 2.txt

13: so goat -> Empty

14: so mary -> 1.txt 2.txt 3.txt

15: so little lamb -> 1.txt 2.txt 3.txt 4.txt

16: so mary a -> 1.txt 2.txt 3.txt 4.txt

17: so MaRY A -> 1.txt 2.txt 3.txt 4.txt

18: so emu mary a -> 1.txt 2.txt 3.txt 4.txt

19: so mary had a little -> 1.txt 2.txt 3.txt 4.txt

20: so bleu -> 5.txt
